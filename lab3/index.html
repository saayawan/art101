			<h1>Lab 3 - File Structure and File Transfer</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create a local file structure on my computer and add index.html</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didnâ€™t encounter any technical problems during the process. All of my images and links worked as expected the first time, likely because I followed the naming conventions and file structure carefully. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this lab felt like a good way to reinforce basic HTML and file organization skills. It was satisfying to see everything come together and work without issues. It also gave me more confidence in using GitHub Desktop and testing my files locally before uploading.
