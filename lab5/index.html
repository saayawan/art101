					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>At first, I struggled because this was my first time learning about JavaScript variables. It was a bit confusing to understand how to declare them and what data types like strings, booleans, and numbers really meant. I wasn’t sure when to use quotation marks or how to properly combine variables with text output using console.log() or document.writeln().
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>One small issue I had was forgetting semicolons at the end of lines, which caused errors in the console. I also initially wrote document.writein() instead of document.writeln()—but I realized the correct spelling by checking the instructions again. Debugging with the Chrome Inspector helped me catch and fix these problems.
					</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>After practicing in the console and writing everything again in my JavaScript file, I started to get more comfortable. It felt good to see everything printed out clearly on the webpage. Now I understand how useful variables are, and I feel more confident using them in future projects. Working with a partner also helped me talk through some confusing parts and learn faster. </p>
