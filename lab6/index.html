			<h1>Lab 6 - JavaScript Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>I experimented with arrays and objects in JavaScript and learned how to access and display them in the browser.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had trouble printing the object nicely on the webpage because just using document.writeln(myMainRide) didn't work. We learned we had to use JSON.stringify() to make the object readable in the browser.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this lab was easy to complete, but I still learned a lot about how arrays and objects work in JavaScript. I got more comfortable using console.log() to check my code, and I learned how important it is to format objects properly when displaying them on a webpage. It was also a good reminder to double-check file links and syntax. This practice will definitely help me in future projects.</p>
